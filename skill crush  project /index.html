                    <p>I’ve made my home base in New Jersey, As me and my family would be moving there in the few weeks.

                       button for me as a child groiwing up.
                        I was fascinated with how easily I could get a computer to carry out orders i give it.
                      I was hooked and wanted to learn how to build my own site to fit my own specific needs. Which brought me right in to Front- End Development</p>

                      <p>That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I learned how to build my first website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom & versatility I was looking for in my work. Now I’ve made a full switch to front-end development, where I can use my organization skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code.</p>
